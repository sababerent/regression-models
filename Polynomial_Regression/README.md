# Height vs Weight Polynomial Regression

This project aims to build a polynomial regression model to predict weight based on height. The dataset used contains height and weight values, and the model is designed to capture the non-linear relationship between the two variables through polynomial regression.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: The dataset consists of height and weight data points, used to analyze how height influences weight.
- **Model**: A polynomial regression model is applied to predict weight based on height. The model is trained using polynomial features to capture the non-linear relationship between the two variables.
- **Goal**: To explore the effectiveness of polynomial regression for predicting weight based on height and to visualize the resulting curve.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd repository-name
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python Height_Vs_Weight_Polynomial_Regression.py
    ```

## Results

Once you run the program, you will see the polynomial regression model fit the height and weight data. The model's predictions will be visualized in a graph, showing how well the polynomial curve matches the data points.
